# Escape-Room-Game
A point-and-click escape room game created as a group project for web technologies module.
The game involves escaping Chernobyl, navigating your way through various rooms through investigative work and collecting items.

All work I created is in the folder TIARNAN.
Please watch 40293936_Tiarnan Duffy.mp4 for a video demonstration of my level.

I created level 4 (the final level).
